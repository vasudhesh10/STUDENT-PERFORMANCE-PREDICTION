# Student Performance Prediction System

## Introduction

The Student Performance Prediction System is a Python-based project that aims to predict the academic performance of students based on various features such as gender, nationality, grade, section, and more. The system utilizes machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network (MLP Classifier) to make predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
cd student-performance-prediction
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python student_performance_prediction.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the type of graph or prediction you want to see.

4. Optionally, you can test specific input data to see predictions for individual cases.

## Project Structure

- `student_performance_prediction.py`: The main Python script containing the project code.
- `AI-Data.csv`: CSV file containing the student performance dataset.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Data Preprocessing

- The script includes data preprocessing steps such as dropping unnecessary columns, label encoding categorical variables, and shuffling the dataset.

## Machine Learning Models

The project utilizes the following machine learning models:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Perceptron (Linear Model)
- Logistic Regression (Linear Model)
- MLP Classifier (Neural Network)

## Graphical Analysis

The script provides graphical analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib, allowing users to visualize class distribution based on various factors such as gender, nationality, grade, etc.

## Accuracy Measurement

The accuracy of each machine learning model is measured and displayed, providing insights into the performance of the models.

## Testing Individual Input

Users can test the system with specific input data to obtain predictions for an individual student's performance.
